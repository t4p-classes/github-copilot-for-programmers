# Improve C++ Code with GitHub Copilot

## Detect Improper Use of Pointers and References with Github Copilot

To run the following code, please create a "Hello World" style C++ project
using Visual Studio or JetBrain's CLion. You may use whatever project and
build tools you would like.

1. Open the C++ file with the `main` function. Replace the code in the file,
   with this code.

  ```cpp
  #include <iostream>
  
  int main() {
    int* ptr = nullptr;
    int& ref = *ptr;
  
    int value = 10;
    ptr = &value;
  
    std::cout << "Value through reference: " << ref << std::endl;
  
    return 0;
  }
  ```

2. Do you see the issue? A reference is created to a null pointer is 
   created with this code `int& ref = *ptr;`. Static code analysis tools 
   will probably pick it up. Can GitHub Copilot catch the problem?

3. Highlight the code, and ask GitHub Copilot to review the code and suggest
   a fix if needed. Copilot will probably reply with something similar to this.

    **Problem 1: Dereferencing a Null Pointer**
    
    In the provided code, a reference is created to a null pointer. This is undefined behavior in C++ and can lead to runtime errors. 
    
    Here is the problematic code:
    
    int* ptr = nullptr;
    int& ref = *ptr;  // Creating a reference to a null pointer
    
    The fix is to ensure that the pointer points to a valid memory location before creating a reference to it.
    
    Here is the fixed code:
    
    int value = 10;
    int* ptr = &value;
    int& ref = *ptr;  // Now the reference is to a valid memory location
    
    **Fixed Version of the Code**
    
    Here is the completely fixed version of the code:
    
    #include <iostream>
    
    int main() {
      int value = 10;
      int* ptr = &value;
      int& ref = *ptr;  // Now the reference is to a valid memory location
    
      // Using the reference
      std::cout << "Value through reference: " << ref << std::endl;
    
      return 0;
    }
    ```

4. Fix the code as suggested, and run it to verify it still works.

    ```cpp
    #include <iostream>
    
    int main() {
      int value = 10;
      int* ptr = &value;
      int& ref = *ptr;
    
      std::cout << "Value through reference: " << ref << std::endl;
    
      return 0;
    }
    ```
