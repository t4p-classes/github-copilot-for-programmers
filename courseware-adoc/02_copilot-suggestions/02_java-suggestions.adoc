=== Demo: Java Code Suggestions

The following demo will explore how to use the in-editor code suggestions provided by GitHub Copilot. Create a new "Hello, World!" style Java console project. Open the project in IntelliJ IDEA.

. Create a function that adds two numbers together. In the editor, type in the following comment.

[source,java]
----
// add two numbers together
----

[start=2]
. Type `<TAB>` to accept the suggestion. Observe how the suggestion follows the coding example of the `addTwoNumbers` function.

[source,java]
----
private static int addTwoNumbers(int firstNumber, int secondNumber) {
    return firstNumber + secondNumber;
}
----

[start=3]
. Delete the accepted code, place cursor at end of the original comment, then hit `<ENTER>`. On the IntelliJ IDEA menu, click `Tools` > `Copilot` > `Show Completions`. Review the suggestions that appear. Accept one of the suggestions, if you like.
