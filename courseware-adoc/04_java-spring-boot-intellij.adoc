== GitHub Copilot for Programmers: Opening Demo

===  Create a Spring Boot REST API Application in IntelliJ IDEA

This is a demo to show how to use GitHub Copilot to help you write a new Java Spring Boot REST API application. These are suggested prompts to use with GitHub Copilot. Feel free modify them or add additional prompts to get the desired results.

.Ordered
. Install the GitHub Copilot Plugin for IntelliJ IDEA. Optionally, disable the JetBrains AI plugin to avoid conflicts with GitHub Copilot.
. Open IntelliJ IDEA, and create a new project with the following options:

- Generator: Spring Initializr
- Name: ToolsAppApi
- Group: com.training4programmers
- Language: Java
- Type: Maven
- Java Version 21 (or latest)

Click `Next`.  Under `Dependencies`, under the `Web` category, select `Spring Web`. Then, under the `SQL` category, select `H2 Database`. Click `Create`. A new Spring Web Project will be created.

[start=3]
. On the right-side activity bar, open the GitHub Copilot chat panel. Also, ensure the Java file `ToolsAppApiApplication.java` located in the `src/main/java/com.training4programmers.toolsappapi` directory is open. GitHub Copilot will only use files opened in the editor when formulating prompts to the GitHub Copilot service to generate suggestions.

. Let's add a new "Hello, World!" REST API endpoint. In the Copilot chat window, type the following prompt:

[source,text,width=60]
----
I need to implement a Hello World REST API endpoint accessible on the path "/hello". How do I add this to my project?
----

**You should get a response similar to this:**

To implement a Hello World REST API endpoint in your Spring Boot application, you need to create a new controller class. This class will handle the HTTP requests coming to the "/hello" path.

Here's a step-by-step plan:

1. Create a new class named `HelloController` in the same package as your main application class.
2. Annotate this class with `@RestController` to indicate that it's a controller class.
3. Define a method named `helloWorld` that will handle GET requests to the "/hello" path. Annotate this method with `@GetMapping("/hello")`.
4. This method should return a `String` that says "Hello, World!".

Here's the code for the `HelloController` class:

[source,java]
----
package com.training4programmers.toolsappapi;

import org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.GetMapping;
import org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.RestController;

@RestController
public class HelloController {

    @GetMapping("/hello")
    public String helloWorld() {
        return "Hello, World!";
    }
}
----
After adding this class to your project, you can start your application and access the endpoint at `http://localhost:8080/hello`. It will return the string "Hello, World!".
