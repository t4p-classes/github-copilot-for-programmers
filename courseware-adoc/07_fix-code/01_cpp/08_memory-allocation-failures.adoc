=== C++: Detect Memory Allocation Failures

To run the following code, please create a "Hello World" style C++ project using Visual Studio or JetBrain's CLion. You may use whatever project and build tools you would like.

. Open the C++ file with the `main` function. Replace the code in the file, with this code.

[%linenums,cpp]
----
#include <iostream>
#include <new>

int main() {
  int* largeArray = nullptr;

  largeArray = new int[1000000000000];

  delete[] largeArray;

  return 0;
}
----

[start=2]
. Do you see the issue? A large array is being allocated, most likely this will fail and a `std::bad_alloc` exception will be thrown. Static code analysis tools will probably not detect this problem. Can GitHub Copilot catch the problem?

[start=3]
. Highlight the code, and ask GitHub Copilot to review the code and suggest a fix if needed.

*Copilot will probably reply with something similar to this:*

*Problem 1: Memory Allocation Size*

The code is trying to allocate a very large amount of memory (1 trillion integers) which is likely to exceed the available memory, causing a `std::bad_alloc` exception to be thrown.

*Before:*

[%linenums,cpp]
largeArray = new int[1000000000000];

*After:*

[%linenums,cpp]
----
try {
    largeArray = new int[1000000]; // Reduced size
} catch (const std::bad_alloc& e) {
    std::cerr << "Memory allocation failed: " << e.what() << '\n';
    return 1;
}
----

*Fixed Version of the Code:*

[%linenums,cpp]
----
#include <iostream>
#include <new>

int main() {
    int* largeArray = nullptr;

    try {
        largeArray = new int[1000000]; // Reduced size
    } catch (const std::bad_alloc& e) {
        std::cerr << "Memory allocation failed: " << e.what() << '\n';
        return 1;
    }

    delete[] largeArray;

    return 0;
}
----

This version of the code reduces the size of the memory allocation to a more reasonable amount and adds error handling for the memory allocation.


[start=4]
. Fix the code as suggested, and run it to verify it still works.

[%linenums,cpp]
----
#include <iostream>
#include <new>

int main() {
  int* largeArray = nullptr;

  try {
    largeArray = new int[1000000]; // Reduced size
  } catch (const std::bad_alloc& e) {
    std::cerr << "Memory allocation failed: " << e.what() << '\n';
    return 1;
  }

  delete[] largeArray;

  return 0;
}
