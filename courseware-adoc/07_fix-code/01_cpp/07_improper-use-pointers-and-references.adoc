=== C++: Detect Improper Use of Pointers and References

To run the following code, please create a "Hello World" style C++ project using Visual Studio or JetBrain's CLion. You may use whatever project and build tools you would like.

. Open the C++ file with the `main` function. Replace the code in the file, with this code.

[%linenums,cpp]
----
#include <iostream>

int main() {
  int* ptr = nullptr;
  int& ref = *ptr;

  int value = 10;
  ptr = &value;

  std::cout << "Value through reference: " << ref << std::endl;

  return 0;
}
----

[start=2]
. Do you see the issue? A reference is created to a null pointer is created with this code `int& ref = *ptr;`. Static code analysis tools will probably pick it up. Can GitHub Copilot catch the problem?

[start=3]
. Highlight the code, and ask GitHub Copilot to review the code and suggest a fix if needed.

*Copilot will probably reply with something similar to this.*

*Problem 1: Dereferencing a Null Pointer*

In the provided code, a reference is created to a null pointer. This is undefined behavior in C++ and can lead to runtime errors. 

Here is the problematic code:

[%linenums,cpp]
----
int* ptr = nullptr;
int& ref = *ptr;  // Creating a reference to a null pointer
----

The fix is to ensure that the pointer points to a valid memory location before creating a reference to it.

Here is the fixed code:

[%linenums,cpp]
----
int value = 10;
int* ptr = &value;
int& ref = *ptr;  // Now the reference is to a valid memory location
----

*Fixed Version of the Code*

Here is the completely fixed version of the code:

[%linenums,cpp]
----
#include <iostream>

int main() {
  int value = 10;
  int* ptr = &value;
  int& ref = *ptr;  // Now the reference is to a valid memory location

  // Using the reference
  std::cout << "Value through reference: " << ref << std::endl;

  return 0;
}

[start=4]
. Fix the code as suggested, and run it to verify it still works.

[%linenums,cpp]
----
#include <iostream>

int main() {
  int value = 10;
  int* ptr = &value;
  int& ref = *ptr;

  std::cout << "Value through reference: " << ref << std::endl;

  return 0;
}
