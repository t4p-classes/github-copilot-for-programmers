=== C++: Detect a Buffer Overflow

To run the following code, please create a "Hello World" style C++ project using Visual Studio or JetBrain's CLion. You may use whatever project and build tools you would like.

. Open the C++ file with the `main` function. Replace the code in the file, with this code.

[%linenums,cpp]
----
#include <iostream>
#include <cstring>

int main() {
  char buffer[10];

  const char* source = "This string is too long for the buffer";

  strcpy(buffer, source);

  std::cout << "Buffer content: " << buffer << std::endl;

  return 0;
}
----
    
Compile the code, and run it.

[start=2]
. Can you identify the buffer overflow? If you run the code through a
   static code analysis tool it will tell you the size of string referenced 
   by the `source` variable is larger than the memory allocated and 
   referenced by the `buffer` variable.

[start=3]
. Highlight the code, right-click, and ask Copilot to fix the code. Apply
   the recommended fix and ensure the code works as expected.

[start=4]
. Here is a reference solution to compare your code to.

[%linenums,cpp]
----
#include <iostream>
#include <cstring>

int main() {
  char buffer[10];

  const char* source = "This string is too long for the buffer";

  strncpy(buffer, source, sizeof(buffer) - 1);
  buffer[sizeof(buffer) - 1] = '\0'; // Ensure null-termination

  std::cout << "Buffer content: " << buffer << std::endl;

  return 0;
}
