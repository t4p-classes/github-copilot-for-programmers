=== Python: Dictionary Key Error

To run the following code, please create a "Hello World" style Python project using Visual Studio or JetBrain's Pycharm.

. Open the Python file with the `main` function. Replace the code in the file, with this code.

[%linenums,java]
----
def main():

    person = {
      "first_name": "John",
      "last_name": "Doe",
    }

    print(person["age"])

  
if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
----

The code should fail to run.

[start=2]
. Highlight the code, right click, mouse over Copilot, and ask Copilot to fix the code in the context menu.

[start=3]
. Copilot should offer a fix similar to this:

[%linenums,java]
----
def main():

    person = {
      "first_name": "John",
      "last_name": "Doe",
      "age": 25,
    }

    print(person["age"])

  
if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
----

[start=4]
. Accept the fix and run the code. The code should run without errors.

[start=5]
. Undo the fix, and ask Copilot to fix the code again. But the add the following text following the `/fix` command:

[source,text]
/fix improve the code so it works even if the age key is not present in the dictionary

[start=6]
. Copilot should offer a fix similar to this:

[source,text]
To improve the code so it works even if the "age" key is not present in the dictionary, I would use the get() method to retrieve the value of the "age" key, and provide a default value of 0 if the key is not found.

[%linenums,java]
----
def main():

    person = {
      "first_name": "John",
      "last_name": "Doe",
    }

    age = person.get("age", 0)
    print(age)

  
if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
----

[start=7]
. Accept the fix and run the code. The code should run without errors.
