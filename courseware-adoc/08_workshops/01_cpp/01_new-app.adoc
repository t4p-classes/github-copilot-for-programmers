# Build a Calculator with C++ and Copilot

## Setup

This tutorial requires Microsoft Windows with Visual Studio Community Edition
and MinGW installed. MinGW can be downloaded
from [Winlibs](https://winlibs.com/). It is recommended to download the latest
UCRT version for your platform, x86 or x64. Finally, extract the archive, and
configure your `PATH` to include the `bin` folder of the extracted archive.

## Steps for Part 1

1. Create a new folder named `calculator-cpp`. Open the folder with VS Code.

2. Ask Copilot how to create a new C++ main file.

    **Copilot Chat Prompt:**
    ```text
    I am working on a new C++ project. Please generate a main file that prints hello world to the console.
    ```

    **Probable Partial Response:**
    ```c++
    #include <iostream>
    
    int main() {
        std::cout << "Hello, World!" << std::endl;
        return 0;
    }
    ```

3. Ask Copilot how to build and run the program.

    **Copilot Chat Prompt:**
    ```text
    How can I compile and run the C++ program you provided? The name of the executable file must be calculator.exe.
    ```

    **Probable Partial Response:**
    ```bash
    g++ main.cpp -o calculator.exe
    ```

3. Open a terminal, and run the following command.

    ```bash
    g++ main.cpp -o calculator.exe
    ```

   Then, run the program.

    ```bash
    calculator.exe
    ```

4. Ask Copilot to generate a CMake configuration.

    **Copilot Chat Prompt:**
    ```text
    Generate a new CMake configuration file for my project named CalculatorCpp. Use cmake version 3.27 and C++ version 23.
    ```

    **Probable Partial Response:**
    ```cmake
    cmake_minimum_required(VERSION 3.27)  # CMake 3.27 or later is required

    # set the project name
    project(CalculatorCpp)

    # specify the C++ standard
    set(CMAKE_CXX_STANDARD 23)

    # add the executable
    add_executable(CalculatorCpp main.cpp)
    ```

5. In the project's root folder, create a new file named `CMakeLists.txt` and
   add the following content to the file.

    ```cmake
    cmake_minimum_required(VERSION 3.27)  # CMake 3.27 or later is required

    # set the project name
    project(CalculatorCpp)

    # specify the C++ standard
    set(CMAKE_CXX_STANDARD 23)

    # add the executable
    add_executable(CalculatorCpp main.cpp)
    ```

6. Ask Copilot how to build the project with cmake.

    **Copilot Chat Prompt:**
    ```text
    How do I build the project with CMake?
    ```
    **Probable Partial Response:**
    ```bash
    mkdir build
    cd build
    
    cmake ..
    
    make
    ```

7. Run the following commands. The `make` command will fail. Instead,
   run `mingw2-make`. It will fail too, because there is no `Makefile.`

    ```bash
    mkdir build
    cd build
    
    cmake ..
    
    make
    
    mingw2-make
    ```

8. Ask GitHub Copilot how to build on Windows when there is no `Makefile` but
   there is a Visual Studio Solution file.

    **Copilot Chat Prompt:**
    ```text
    When running make, I receive an error saying there is no make target, but there is a Visual Studio Solution file. How do I use the CMmake command to execute a build the Visual Studio Solution?
    ```

    **Probable Partial Response:**
    ```bash
    cmake --build .
    ```

9. Run the following CMake build command, then run the executable.

    ```bash
    cmake --build .
    
    Debug\CalculatorCpp.exe
    ```

10. Create a new local git repository.

    ```bash
    git init
    ```

11. Ask GitHub Copilot how to create a `.gitignore` file for a C++ project.

    **Copilot Chat Prompt:**
    ```text
    Generate a Git ignore file for my C++ and CMake project.
    ```

    **Probable Partial Response:**
    ```text
    The contents of a Git ignore file.
    ```

12. Create a new `.gitignore` file, and add the contents suggested by the
    previous response.

13. Add the untracked file, create a commit, and push to a remote.

    ```bash
    git add -A
    
    git commit -m "initial commit"
    
    git remote add origin <SOME REMOTE>
    
    git push
    ```

# Build a Calculator with C++ and Copilot

## Setup

This tutorial builds on the previous tutorial. Complete the previous tutorial
before starting this one. Be sure to open the project in the Visual Studio Code
or JetBrains CLion.

## Steps for Part 2

1. Open the file `main.cpp` in the editor. Then, open the Copilot chat window.

2. Ask Copilot to how to initialize a result variable to 0 and display the 
   result on the screen.

    **Copilot Chat Prompt:**
    ```text
    How do I initialize a result variable to 0 and display the result on the screen?
    ```

    **Probable Partial Response:**
    ```c++
    #include <iostream>
    
    int main() {
        int result = 0;
        std::cout << "The result is: " << result << std::endl;
        return 0;
    }
    ```

3. Update the `main` function with the following code:

    ```c++
    int main() {
    
      int result = 0;
    
      std::cout << "The result is: " << result << std::endl;
      return 0;
    }
    ```

    Run the project, and verify it works.

4. Ask Copilot to how to read numeric input from the user and add the entered 
   number to the result.

    **Copilot Chat Prompt:**
    ```text
    How does the program accept user input from the console? I would like to have 
    the user enter a number, then add the number to the result.
    ```
    
    **Probable Partial Response:**
    ```c++
    #include <iostream>
    
    int main() {
        int result = 0;
        int input;
    
        std::cout << "Enter a number: ";
        std::cin >> input;
    
        result += input;
    
        std::cout << "The result is: " << result << std::endl;
        return 0;
    }
    ```

5. Update the `main` function to use the following code:

    ```c++
    #include <iostream>
    
    int main() {
        int result = 0;
        int input;
    
        std::cout << "Enter a number: ";
        std::cin >> input;
    
        result += input;
    
        std::cout << "The result is: " << result << std::endl;
        return 0;
    }
    ```

    Compile and run the code. It should work as expected.

6. Ask Copilot to add a loop so the user can enter multiple numbers and 
   continue to add to the result.

    **Copilot Chat Prompt:**
    ```text
    How do I implement a loop so that users can add many numbers to the result?
    ```
    
    **Probable Partial Response:**
    ```text
    To implement a loop that allows users to add multiple numbers to the result, you can use a `while` loop. Here's the step-by-step plan:
    
    1. Initialize a `char` variable to store the user's choice to continue or not.
    2. Start a `do-while` loop. This type of loop will execute the code block at least once before checking the condition.
    3. Inside the loop, prompt the user to enter a number.
    4. Read the user's input and add it to the result.
    5. Display the updated result.
    6. Ask the user if they want to enter another number.
    7. Read the user's choice.
    8. The loop will continue as long as the user enters 'y' or 'Y'.
    
    Here's the code:
    
    #include <iostream>
    
    int main() {
        int result = 0;
        int input;
        char choice;
    
        do {
            std::cout << "Enter a number: ";
            std::cin >> input;
    
            result += input;
    
            std::cout << "The result is: " << result << std::endl;
    
            std::cout << "Do you want to enter another number? (y/n): ";
            std::cin >> choice;
        } while(choice == 'y' || choice == 'Y');
    
        return 0;
    }
    
    This code will keep asking the user to enter a number and add it to the result until the user decides to stop by entering anything other than 'y' or 'Y'.
    ```

7. Using the last Copilot response, update your code, and run the program. Does 
   it work? If it works, then great! If not, continue to step 8 and compare 
   your code to the reference code.

8. Compare your code updates in the previous step to the code below. If your 
   code does not work, please update accordingly.

    ```cpp
    #include <iostream>
    
    int main() {
    
      int result = 0;
      int input;
      char choice;
    
      do {
    
        std::cout << "Enter a number: ";
        std::cin >> input;
    
        result += input;
    
        std::cout << "The result is: " << result << std::endl;
    
        std::cout << "Do you want to enter another number? (y/n): ";
        std::cin >> choice;
    
      } while (choice == 'y' || choice == 'Y');
      
      return 0;
    }
    ```

9. Ask the Copilot chat how to support multiple math operations.

    **Copilot Chat Prompt:**
    ```text
    How do I update the program to support add, subtract, multiply, and divide? 
    The user must choose a math operation on each iteration of the command loop.
    ```
    
    **Probable Partial Response:**
    ```cpp
    #include <iostream>
    
    int main() {
        int result = 0;
        int input;
        char choice;
        char operation;
    
        do {
            std::cout << "Enter a number: ";
            std::cin >> input;
    
            std::cout << "Choose an operation (+, -, *, /): ";
            std::cin >> operation;
    
            switch (operation) {
                case '+':
                    result += input;
                    break;
                case '-':
                    result -= input;
                    break;
                case '*':
                    result *= input;
                    break;
                case '/':
                    if (input != 0) {
                        result /= input;
                    } else {
                        std::cout << "Error: Division by zero is not allowed.\n";
                    }
                    break;
                default:
                    std::cout << "Error: Invalid operation. Please choose +, -, *, or /.\n";
                    continue; // Skip the rest of the loop for this iteration
            }
    
            std::cout << "The result is: " << result << std::endl;
    
            std::cout << "Do you want to enter another number? (y/n): ";
            std::cin >> choice;
        } while (choice == 'y' || choice == 'Y');
    
        return 0;
    }
    ```

    Using the response from Copilot, please update your code.

   10. Compare you code to the reference code below. Make any needed 
       adjustments. Your code does not have to match this code exactly. Simply 
       use the code to ensure similar functionality and to resolve any bugs you 
       may have.

       ```cpp
       #include <iostream>
    
       int main() {
    
         int result = 0;
         int input;
         char choice;
         char operation;
    
         do {
    
           std::cout << "Enter a number: ";
           std::cin >> input;
    
           std::cout << "Choose an operation (+, -, *, /): ";
           std::cin >> operation;
    
           switch (operation) {
             case '+':
               result += input;
               break;
             case '-':
               result -= input;
               break;
             case '*':
               result *= input;
               break;
             case '/':
               // -- used the comment below to encourage Copilot suggestion --
               // Check for division by zero
               if (input == 0) {
                 std::cout << "Division by zero is not allowed." << std::endl;
               } else {
                 result /= input;
               }
               break;
             default:
               // -- used the comment below to encourage Copilot suggestion --
               // show an invalid operation message that includes a list of valid
               // operations
               std::cout << "Error: Invalid operation. Please choose +, -, *, /." <<
               std::endl;
               continue;
           }
    
           std::cout << "The result is: " << result << std::endl;
    
           std::cout << "Do you want to enter another number? (y/n): ";
           std::cin >> choice;
    
         } while (choice == 'y' || choice == 'Y');
    
         return 0;
       }
       ```

11. For part, one final improvement is needed. The user input for the math 
    operation command and the exit loop command need to be combined. Copilot 
    can help us do this. Ask Copilot to refactor our logic to reduce the 
    code to single user input for math operations and loop exit.

    For this step, try writing your own Copilot prompt and follow the 
    suggestion offer by Copilot. A suggested prompt and solution is offered 
    [Part 2 - Solution](./calculator-part-2-solution.md) file.


### Build a Calculator with C++ and Copilot

## Solution for Final Step of Part 2

The Copilot prompt and code below are the solution to final step of part 2. 
This solution is in a separate to give you the change to interact with 
Copilot on your own, using your own prompt, and applying the solution as you 
decide to.

**Copilot Chat Prompt:**
```text
Combine the user input for the math operation command and the exit loop command into a single input and update the appropriate control flow logic. The user input to capture the command/exit should be a different user input than capturing the number.
```

**Probable Partial Response:**
```text
To achieve this, you can modify the program to first ask for the operation and then ask for the number. If the user enters 'q' or 'Q' as the operation, the program will quit. Otherwise, it will ask for a number and perform the chosen operation on the result and the user's input. Here's the updated code:

#include <iostream>

int main() {
    int result = 0;
    int input;
    char operation;

    while (true) {
        std::cout << "Enter an operation (+, -, *, /) or 'q' to quit: ";
        std::cin >> operation;

        if (operation == 'q' || operation == 'Q') {
            break;
        }

        std::cout << "Enter a number: ";
        std::cin >> input;

        switch (operation) {
            case '+':
                result += input;
                break;
            case '-':
                result -= input;
                break;
            case '*':
                result *= input;
                break;
            case '/':
                if (input != 0) {
                    result /= input;
                } else {
                    std::cout << "Error: Division by zero is not allowed.\n";
                }
                break;
            default:
                std::cout << "Error: Invalid operation. Please choose +, -, *, or /.\n";
                continue; // Skip the rest of the loop for this iteration
        }

        std::cout << "The result is: " << result << std::endl;
    }

    return 0;
}

This code will first prompt the user to enter an operation. If the user enters 'q' or 'Q', the program will quit. Otherwise, it will prompt the user to enter a number and perform the chosen operation on the result and the user's input. If the user chooses division and enters zero as the number, the program will print an error message and ask for another operation and number.
```

## Tutorial Reference Solution for Part 2

The following code if the final reference solution for the tutorial. Please 
compare your code to ensure similar functionality and that your code works 
as expected.

```cpp
#include <iostream>

int main() {
    int result = 0;
    int input;
    char operation;

    while (true) {
        std::cout << "Enter an operation (+, -, *, /) or 'q' to quit: ";
        std::cin >> operation;

        if (operation == 'q' || operation == 'Q') {
            break;
        }

        std::cout << "Enter a number: ";
        std::cin >> input;

        switch (operation) {
            case '+':
                result += input;
                break;
            case '-':
                result -= input;
                break;
            case '*':
                result *= input;
                break;
            case '/':
                if (input != 0) {
                    result /= input;
                } else {
                    std::cout << "Error: Division by zero is not allowed.\n";
                }
                break;
            default:
                std::cout << "Error: Invalid operation. Please choose +, -, *, or /.\n";
                continue; // Skip the rest of the loop for this iteration
        }

        std::cout << "The result is: " << result << std::endl;
    }

    return 0;
}
```
