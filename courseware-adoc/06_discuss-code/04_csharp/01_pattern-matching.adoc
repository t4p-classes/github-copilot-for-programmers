=== C#: Pattern Matching

To run the following code, please create a C# console application using .NET 8, with top-level statements enabled.

. Replace the code in the `Program.cs` file with the following code:

.Program.cs
[%linenums,c#]
----
Shape shape = new Circle { Radius = 5 };
// Shape shape = new Rectangle { Width = 10, Height = 20 };
// Shape shape = new Triangle { Base = 10, Height = 20 };

if (shape is Circle)
{
  Circle circle = (Circle)shape;
  Console.WriteLine($"Processing a circle with radius {circle.Radius}");
}
else if (shape is Rectangle)
{
  Rectangle rectangle = (Rectangle)shape;
  Console.WriteLine($"Processing a rectangle with width {rectangle.Width} and height {rectangle.Height}");
}
else if (shape is Triangle)
{
  Triangle triangle = (Triangle)shape;
  Console.WriteLine($"Processing a triangle with base {triangle.Base} and height {triangle.Height}");
}
else
{
  Console.WriteLine("Unknown shape type");
}

interface Shape
{
  public void Draw();
}

class Circle : Shape
{
  public int Radius { get; set; }
  public void Draw()
  {
    Console.WriteLine("Drawing a circle");
  }
}

class Rectangle : Shape
{
  public int Width { get; set; }
  public int Height { get; set; }
  public void Draw()
  {
    Console.WriteLine("Drawing a rectangle");
  }
}

class Triangle : Shape
{
  public int Base { get; set; }
  public int Height { get; set; }
  public void Draw()
  {
    Console.WriteLine("Drawing a triangle");
  }
}
----

Run the code, it should work as expected.

. Is this the best way to write this code using modern C#? Why or why not?
. Highlight the following code block.

.Program.cs
[%linenums,c#]
----
if (shape is Circle)
{
  Circle circle = (Circle)shape;
  Console.WriteLine($"Processing a circle with radius {circle.Radius}");
}
else if (shape is Rectangle)
{
  Rectangle rectangle = (Rectangle)shape;
  Console.WriteLine($"Processing a rectangle with width {rectangle.Width} and height {rectangle.Height}");
}
else if (shape is Triangle)
{
  Triangle triangle = (Triangle)shape;
  Console.WriteLine($"Processing a triangle with base {triangle.Base} and height {triangle.Height}");
}
else
{
  Console.WriteLine("Unknown shape type");
}
----

Once the code is highlighted in the Visual Studio editor, right-click, and select `Ask Copilot` from the content menu. In the dialog that appears, ask the following question:

.Copilot Chat Prompt
[source,text]
/fix Is this the best way to write this code?

[start=3]
.Remember, Copilot is non-deterministic so the solution mentioned here may not match the solution that Copilot provides you with. When writing this tutorial, the following solution was suggested by Copilot.

.Copilot Proposed Change
[%linenums,c#]
----
if (shape is Circle circle)
{
  Console.WriteLine($"Processing a circle with radius {circle.Radius}");
}
else if (shape is Rectangle rectangle)
{
  Console.WriteLine($"Processing a rectangle with width {rectangle.Width} and height {rectangle.Height}");
}
else if (shape is Triangle triangle)
{
  Console.WriteLine($"Processing a triangle with base {triangle.Base} and height {triangle.Height}");
}
else
{
  Console.WriteLine("Unknown shape type");
}
----

You will notice the lines of code casting the object from one type to another for each code branch have been removed and replaced with newer pattern-matching syntax in the `if` statement conditional expression. The enhanced conditional expression is a more modern way to write the code and is more readable.

Can this be further improved? Accept the suggested change, and we will continue the discussion.

[start=4]
. Highlight the same code block as before, and open the Copilot chat window.

.Program.cs
[%linenums,c#]
----
if (shape is Circle circle)
{
  Console.WriteLine($"Processing a circle with radius {circle.Radius}");
}
else if (shape is Rectangle rectangle)
{
  Console.WriteLine($"Processing a rectangle with width {rectangle.Width} and height {rectangle.Height}");
}
else if (shape is Triangle triangle)
{
  Console.WriteLine($"Processing a triangle with base {triangle.Base} and height {triangle.Height}");
}
else
{
  Console.WriteLine("Unknown shape type");
}
----

In the chat window, ask the following question:

.Copilot Chat Prompt
[source,text]
/fix Is an if-else chain the best way to structure this? Does pattern matching support a cleaner control flow structure?

Copilot chat will probably suggest the following code improvement:

.Copilot Proposed Change
[%linenums,c#]
----
switch (shape)
{
    case Circle circle:
        Console.WriteLine($"Processing a circle with radius {circle.Radius}");
        break;
    case Rectangle rectangle:
        Console.WriteLine($"Processing a rectangle with width {rectangle.Width} and height {rectangle.Height}");
        break;
    case Triangle triangle:
        Console.WriteLine($"Processing a triangle with base {triangle.Base} and height {triangle.Height}");
        break;
    default:
        Console.WriteLine("Unknown shape type");
        break;
}
----

Compare this final code to the original code at the start of the tutorial. The final code is more readable and easier to understand. It also uses the modern pattern-matching syntax to improve the control flow structure. This is a good example of how Copilot can help you write better code - even experienced programmers can learn from Copilot's suggestions.
